  in the final version wifi will only be running sparsely and may interrupt other functionality. RemoteXY will need a check every 10 seconds or so. audio will play fragments of say 5-15 seconds every 15 minutes. various fastled light shows will be running all day - and will be modified by audio-play. and there will be sensor checking on activity. Other info and opinion: fadeIn and Out should be Frertos tasks to be called with every audio and reused.  You previous attempts resulted in crashes by null pointers all the time -prevent them now!
